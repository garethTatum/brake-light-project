 ### Abstract:
 #### According to a 2020 report by the NTSB, car crash fatalities have risen to the highest point since 2007, with 50% of rear-end collisions being preventable with forward collision warning systems. This supervised machine learning project predicts other vehicles' braking to warn of potential collisions ahead. Using the brake light detection model from Aalto University (Jesse Pirhonen, 2022) as the supervisor on the University of California Berkeley DeepDrive dataset of dashcam video footage, a specially trained logistic regression model predicts brake light onsets with 98% accuracy when measured against the Aalto brake light detector and 91.48% accuracy when compared against manually labeled test scenarios, for which the Aalto brake light detector has 73.68% accuracy, yielding 17.8% improvement. If the specialized brake predictor model were integrated into automatic braking systems already found in many cars, it could help to prevent almost 800,000 collisions per year.
